# robot-code
a place for our new robot code, now with android studio!

If you are having trouble connecting to the control hub, connect to the wifi then do adb connect 192.168.43.1:5555 in a console/terminal.

if needed, download platform tools here for adb. https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools

you may need to go into the platformtools folder and do ./adb to acess it if adb is not in PATH.
